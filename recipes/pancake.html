        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups Egg Whites</li>
            <li>4 Slices White Bread</li>
            <li>4 Packs Sweetener</li>
            <li>2 tsp Cinnamon</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Vanilla Extract</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp Guar/Xanthan Gum</li>
            <li>100g blueberries</li>
            <li>0.5 cup Low Calorie Syrup</li>
            <li>Cooking Spray</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a blender, add bread slices, egg whites, guar/xanthan gum,
                sweetener, vanilla extract,and cinnamon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Blend on high until mixture is uniform in consistency. Remove
                mix from the blender and add to a fridge-safe airtight
                container.
            </li>
            <li>
                (OPTIONAL): Let sit for 2-3 hours or more in the refrigerator.
                The longer you let the mixture rest, the better it binds. (Note:
                it can be cooked right away but it's better if it has time to
                sit).
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a griddle over low-medium heat. Spray griddle with cooking
                spray. Add mixture to griddle and let sit for 1-2 minutes until
                edges appear cooked through.
            </li>
            <li>Add blueberries to the pancake in the griddle.</li>
            <li>
                Once edges start to brown and pancake appears to be visibly
                cooked about 2/3 of the way, flip the pancake in the griddle and
                let sit another 1-2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove pancake from the griddle and serve on a plate with low
                calorie syrup or leftover blueberries.
            </li>
        </ol>
